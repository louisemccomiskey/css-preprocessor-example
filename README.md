Tiny repo to get setup with compiling scss to css quickly

After cloning you only need to run:
`npm install`

run build and watch commands:

`npm run build-css` - to build the scss into css
`npm run watch-css` - to watch over the css files and any changes it will recompile.



Initial setup:

'git init' - to initialise git

'npm init' - to create a blank package.json file

`npm install -D node-sass nodemon` - to install sass and nodemon

created a .gitignore file and add node_modules to it so it is pushed.
